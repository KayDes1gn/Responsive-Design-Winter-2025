# Convert Figma mockup to HTML/CSS

1. Looking at the Figma mockup, at mobile scale, identify which backgrounds belong to which HTML element:
    - Header
    - Main
    - Footer

2. In Figma, turn off the visibility of any foreground element (\<h1> or \<p> text, \<img> tag images, etc) that you use an HTML tag for and can style with CSS. In other words, hide the content. 

3. Specifically identify these types of backgrounds:
    - a simple background photo
    - a more complex background effect created by using multiple background images layered one over the other.
    - Graphic elements "anchored" to the very top or very bottom of the HTML element (requiring the use of ::before or ::after pseudo-elements).

4. With the monitor set to inspecting the web page at 320px, and your mobile phone open to the same page, open the bioblitz page. 

5. In Figma:
   1. Select an element (photo, icon, etc - not text) in the header area
   2. At the bottomof the right hand column, select "Export"
   3. Choose 2x
   4. Choose the appropriate file format:
      1. JPEG for photographs
      2. SVG for anything vector
      3. PNG: Only if there is transparency, but avoid as the files are usually too big. It is better to "fake" the transparency effect in Photoshop.
   5. Click the ellipsis (...)
   6. Add a 2x suffix
   7. Color profile is sRGB
   8. Image Resampling: Detailed
   9. Click Export
   10. Repeat Steps 3-9 for 1x (not necessary for SVGs)
6.  In your CSS:

        header {
            background-image: url(css/img/bg.jpg); /* 1x version */
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-size: cover;
        }

        @media (min-resolution: 2x) {

        header {
            background-image: url(css/img/bg2x.jpg); /* 2x version */
            /* no need to repeat css properties that donâ€™t change */
        }

        } /* always comment closing media query */

## Using Pseudo-Elements

<blockquote>
A Pseudo-Element is a "virtual div" that you can add before and/or after any HTML element. It can hold text, or be used to add background images.

As a reminder of what we did last semester:

        header {
            position: relative;
            /* forces absolutely positioned child elements to be placed relative to the top/left corner of this element by default */
        }

        header::before {
            content: " "; 
            /* content cannot be empty */

            position: absolute;
            /* position anywhere you like, on a layer */

            z-index: -1;
            /* control stacking like "send to back" */

            display: block;
            /* behave as normal block level element */

            background-image: url(css/img/bg.jpg);
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-size: cover; /* or "contain" */
            /* add background as usual */

            width: 100%;
            height: 5rem;
            /* control size explicitly */

            top: -5rem; 
            /* match height to position above header */

            left: 0;
            /* align left */
        }
