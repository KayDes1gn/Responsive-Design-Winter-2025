## Last Year's "Sustainability Projects"

### BioBlitz 2024 (Digital Photo II)

Last year’s BioBlitz involved areas other than John Abbott, i.e. McGill’s Morgan Arboretum, this year it will only include the John Abbott campus.

We can improve JAC community buy-in with online promotion on JAC’s video displays, on the web and on Instagram.
